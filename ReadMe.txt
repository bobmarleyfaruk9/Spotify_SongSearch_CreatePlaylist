Installation:
    npm install 

Running the server:
    node server.js

Notes:
    I have decided to use the Spotify API. The authentication process takes some time so the first search
    will be slow. I have referenced some code from the offical spotify github.

Rare Issue:
    The authentication code uses deprecated dependencies. 
    Which rarely causes the program to fail. 
   

Tested on:
    node v19.1.0 
    macOS Ventura 13.0.1
